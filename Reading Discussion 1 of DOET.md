Personal Thoughts: <br> 
I feel that chapter 1, though very bulky in things to read, had strong insight on how to break down everyday things with the perspective of design, as the book describes. It reminds me of a holistic approach of seeing the problem as a whole, but responding to it in ways design can minimize it. For instance, on page 19, discussing the British Telecom Telephone, it showed a variety of bindings to hold, call, or retrieve another call. Using lots of inputs such as dialing and button pressing made for a consistent system, yet can be confusing to many. Off of that, one personal example I think of would be old compact and complicated tv remotes. Nowadays they are minimized to primary buttons and occasionally voice control, but looking back on how much progress designs have made with the countless buttons, it showed how inconvenient it was back then, just that we didn't realize it until later. Another example was on page 15, discussing the temperature control of refrigerators. The way it was designed for balancing control over frozen and fresh foods. Overall it would be generally straight forward to understand, but in reality its only one thermostat and mechanism. Both the fridge and the dial up phone carried designs that could get as simplest as possible in their respective times, but it can be more appreciated of the fact how much they improved those designs now. Phone calls are now wireless, can be answered through no less than 1-3 button presses, or outright voice recognition. For fridges, there are multiple compartments that carry more concise temperature control, and even ice making. I find these most interesting as it reflects what we considered the optimal design at the time. What I appreciate are also simplistic instructions. Doors make a good example with how common they are, such as ones that push and pulls. To remove the need for push and pull signs, I guess one example would be to tint the color of the glass, indicating there is in fact a surface not to accidentally walk into. Automatic doors would also be an example, as they would queue people in to move. One more example of improvement can be umbrellas, with their physical design changes. They definitely improved as they previously were too large to carry for convenience, often flimsy to handle strong weather, or too small to cover more than two people at best. Now they are compact, smaller than most water bottles, and are more durable and can sometimes huddle a small group. The strengths of their design progression lies in those problems being minimized overtime. All things considered, this chapter heavily lead me to think about the progression of design and the way our approached changed overtime.
